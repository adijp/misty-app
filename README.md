# misty-app

This repository contains all the code for Misty, a personal finance app which helps users budget smarter.

Misty uses [Plaid](https://www.plaid.com) to securely connect to bank accounts in US and Canada. Misty relies on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for the backend. In particular, Misty uses Firebase Authentication for handling user auth and Firestore as a document database.

This app was built using the [Plaid Quickstart](https://github.com/plaid/quickstarthttps://www.plaid.com) module on Github as a starting point. The landing page for Misty is built using [000kelvin/react-landing-page](https://github.com/000kelvin/react-landing-page).
